## üìä Implemented Components

### 1. RAG Query Engine (`ragQueryEngine.ts`)

**Primary Features:**
- Multi-step query processing pipeline
- Business context enhancement using Alice Intelligence
- Multi-strategy search execution (semantic, hybrid, framework-specific)
- Context assembly and ranking with confidence scoring
- Implementation guidance generation

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
async processQuery(originalQuery: string, userContext?: UserContext): Promise<RAGResponse>
async executeMultiStrategySearch(query: RAGQuery): Promise<SearchResult[]>
async assembleAndRankContext(searchResults: SearchResult[], query: RAGQuery): Promise<EnhancedSourceChunk[]>
```

## üîç Advanced Search Features

### Business Context Understanding

```typescript
// Query: "How to improve LTV in my gym business"
Enhanced Processing:
- Detected Framework: LTV Optimization, Gym Launch methodology
- Business Context: Fitness industry, customer retention focus
- Implementation Signals: "improve" indicates optimization intent
- Expanded Query: "LTV lifetime value customer value gym fitness retention strategies Gym Launch"
```

### Multi-Strategy Search Execution

1. **Primary Semantic Search**: Core vector similarity matching
2. **Framework-Specific Search**: Targeted searches for detected frameworks
3. **Business Phase Search**: Content filtered by business stage
4. **Scenario-Based Search**: Business situation-specific content

### Result Enhancement and Diversification

- Contextual highlighting of query-relevant content
- Content snippet optimization for business relevance
- Result diversification to avoid redundancy
- Business intelligence metadata enrichment

## üíº Business Intelligence Integration

### Alice Intelligence Coordination

The RAG system deeply integrates with Alice Intelligence's business optimization strategies:

**Query Enhancement:**
- Business terminology expansion using Alice's knowledge architecture
- Framework detection using Alice's hierarchy system
- Search optimization using Alice's semantic clusters

**Content Prioritization:**
- Tier 1: Core Hormozi frameworks (highest priority)
- Tier 2: Business scaling systems (high priority) 
- Tier 3: Implementation tactics (medium priority)

**Citation Integration:**
- Multi-level attribution using Alice's citation system
- Authority scoring based on Alice's verification hierarchy
- Cross-reference validation for content consistency

### Framework-Specific Processing

```typescript
HormoziFramework Detection Patterns:
- GRAND_SLAM_OFFERS: "grand slam", "value equation", "irresistible offer"
- CORE_FOUR: "warm outreach", "cold outreach", "warm content", "cold content"  
- CLOSER_FRAMEWORK: "clarify", "label", "overview", "sell", "explain away"
- LTV_CAC_OPTIMIZATION: "lifetime value", "customer acquisition cost", "unit economics"
```

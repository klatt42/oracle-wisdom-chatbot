# ðŸ”„ BMAD Agent Replication Template

## Overview
Master template for recreating BMAD agents in new projects.

## Agent Templates
- Executive agents (3): CEO, Ellen, Oscar
- Specialized agents (8): Elena, Sarah, Marcus, Alice, Alex, Victoria, David

## Setup Process
1. Create agent profiles in Archon OS
2. Document agent specializations
3. Establish coordination protocols
4. Deploy agent tasks

## Replication Guide
Copy BMAD structure to new project and adapt for specific domain.

## Reusable BMAD Components

### Core Agent Roles (Universal)
1. **Operations VP** - Task coordination and resource management
2. **Executive Assistant** - Communication and status reporting
3. **Technical Lead** - Implementation and development
4. **Quality Director** - Testing and validation
5. **Analytics Director** - Performance monitoring
6. **Infrastructure Lead** - System architecture
7. **Intelligence Director** - Domain knowledge optimization
8. **Strategy Lead** - Business planning and optimization

### Coordination Framework (Standard)
- Daily coordination sync (15 minutes)
- Weekly executive reporting
- Monthly performance review
- Quarterly system optimization

### Performance Metrics (Adaptable)
- Agent utilization efficiency
- Task completion velocity
- Collaboration effectiveness
- Business outcome achievement

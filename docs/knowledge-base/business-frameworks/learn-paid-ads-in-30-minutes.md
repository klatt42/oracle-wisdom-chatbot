## Scaling Paid Ads
- To scale paid ads, it's essential to understand the target audience and their pain points, such as dentists who want to retire or stop taking calls, and create ads that speak to those pain points [(00:00:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=59s)
- For local businesses like a $600k acupuncture business, running lead ads for a free or low-cost offer can be an effective strategy, and then creating a sales process to filter for qualified customers [(00:01:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=114s)
- For a 3 million dollar CrossFit coach business, retargeting campaigns and owning PPC terms can be effective, as well as creating valuable content to give away for free, and using proof such as customer testimonials to build trust [(00:05:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=300s)

## Scaling Business through Ad Creatives
- To scale a business, one approach is to drive down customer acquisition cost (CAC) or increase the average customer value (LTV), and this can be achieved by improving ad creatives, such as modeling the first three seconds of top-performing ads [(00:11:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=675s).
- Bundling products or services can increase the average order value, for example, offering a year's worth of creams or lotions with a high-ticket item like an IPL removal device [(00:12:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=770s).
- Doubling down on creative content as a discipline can help a business, like those in the beauty and consumer industry, to separate themselves from competitors and reach higher revenue goals, such as $20 million a year [(00:14:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=862s).

## Targeting and Setting Calls
- To set calls from a group, there are four ways: pulling people off a call, setting calls from recordings or posts, and two other methods, with the goal of training DM Setters better [(00:17:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=1071s)
- For a Virtual Assistant (VA) business targeting service-based companies like Home Services, it's recommended to start with meta (Facebook and Instagram) ads, as they are easy to target and can show how much money clients can save [(00:18:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=1125s)

## Effective Ad Creation and Trust Building
- When creating ads, allocate resources using the 70-20-10 rule: 70% for the main ad, 20% for adjacent ideas, and 10% for wild ideas, to maximize results and minimize waste [(00:22:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=1320s)
- To increase return on investment (Ro) and build trust, creating content is essential as it grows the organic audience over time, compounding into a significant stream [(00:27:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=1669s)
- Focusing on proof rather than promises is crucial, as everyone makes promises, but few have proof to back it up, making it a unique differentiator in the market [(00:28:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=1706s)
- Utilizing group funnels can be an effective way to build trust, with metrics showing 10% conversion of people who opt-in to the group into the next level, and 30-50% closure rate on calls [(00:29:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSbqaTlWaYI&t=1763s)

## Do What You Want, No One Will Remember [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=0s)

- When someone dies, people's emotions and reactions are often fleeting, and life moves on quickly, which can be a reminder to not take things too seriously [(00:00:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=38s)

## The #1 Skill Everyone Should Learn [(00:10:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=617s)
- The ability to stay in a good mood in the absence of things to be in a good mood about is considered the single greatest skill to develop [(00:10:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=617s)
- Most people don't question someone who's in a bad mood, but being in a good mood for no reason can be just as valid [(00:11:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=676s)
- It's possible to break the relationship between finding things to be grateful for and being in a good mood, allowing for a choice to be in a good mood regardless of circumstances [(00:11:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=713s)

## Risk and Threat Detection [(00:12:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=730s)
- Humans have a negativity bias, making it easier to detect threats and risks than pleasant things [(00:12:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=750s)
- This bias can lead to catastrophizing and overemphasizing potential downsides, while underestimating the upside [(00:16:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=994s)
- Playing out scenarios and considering the actual consequences can help mitigate this bias [(00:18:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1107s)

## Gratitude and Happiness [(00:21:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1291s)
- Finding small things to be happy about can help cultivate a positive mood, even in difficult circumstances [(00:21:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1309s)
- Practicing gratitude by noticing and enriching positive experiences can increase happiness [(00:22:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1345s)
- Operationalizing gratitude by imagining terrible scenarios and then being grateful for their absence can also be effective [(00:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1601s)

## Personal Growth and Development [(00:30:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1818s)
- Recognizing and separating self-judgment from genuine gratitude and happiness can help decrease demands on oneself [(00:30:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1835s)
- Making a pivot from a solely results-driven approach to incorporating happiness and well-being can be a significant but valuable change [(00:31:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1909s)
- Developing skills to find joy and gratitude in everyday moments can lead to increased overall happiness [(00:32:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1928s)

## How To Not Let 1 Bad Day Spiral Into More [(00:32:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1955s)
- Focusing on having a good day can help during a bad season, as stringing together a few good days can make the bad season feel less difficult [(00:32:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1955s)
- The difference between a happy life and an unhappy one may come down to which days are thought about repeatedly, rather than the number of good or bad days [(00:32:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1974s)
- In some seasons of life, maintaining and making progress can be considered winning, even if it's not a significant achievement [(00:33:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=1996s)

## Navigating Complex Negative Situations [(00:33:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2032s)
- When faced with complex negative situations, it can be helpful to focus on making progress, rather than trying to solve the entire problem at once [(00:33:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2032s)
- Breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable tasks can help navigate through difficult times [(00:34:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2051s)
- Recognizing that small progress can add up over time, such as 30 or 90 days, can be motivating and help build momentum [(00:34:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2070s)

## Finding Happiness in Small Things [(00:36:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2163s)
- Happiness can be found in small, everyday moments, rather than waiting for significant events or achievements [(00:36:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2163s)
- Focusing on the small things that bring joy and gratitude can help shift perspective and make the ride more enjoyable [(00:36:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2180s)
- Recalibrating one's scale to appreciate smaller victories and finding happiness in tiny moments can be a powerful way to improve overall well-being [(00:37:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2257s)

## Overcoming Adversity and Finding Gratitude [(00:38:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2313s)
- Even in the face of adversity, such as health issues or personal struggles, finding gratitude and appreciation for what is going well can be a powerful tool [(00:38:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2313s)
- Recognizing that entropy and stress can catch up with anyone, even those who appear to be doing well, can help build empathy and understanding [(00:41:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2470s)
- Focusing on the present moment and finding joy in small things can help build resilience and improve overall well-being [(00:42:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2528s)

## The Sacrifices Needed To Be Successful [(00:47:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2855s)
- To achieve the highest levels of success, one must give up proportional amounts of the things they hoped to gain, and the hard work required can be overwhelming at times [(00:47:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=2855s)
- Habituation to failure is narrow, and every new type of failure can still be painful, even if one has experienced failure before [(00:50:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3019s)
- The currency that one pays for success changes over time, and what was once a sacrifice may no longer be considered a sacrifice as one habituates to it [(00:51:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3110s)

## The Nature of Hard Work and Sacrifice [(00:53:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3215s)
- Most people enjoy the work itself once they learn how to work, but it's the sacrifices required to work that can be difficult [(00:53:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3215s)
- The path to achievement is fairly straightforward, but the price of success can be high, and one must consider what they are willing to sacrifice [(00:54:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3251s)
- Finding the sweet spot that maximizes success while allowing for other preferences in life is key, and knowing when to stop striving for more is important [(00:54:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3289s)

## Hormozi’s Flip To Discovering Happiness [(00:58:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3538s)
- Achieving high levels of success often requires giving up things that the achievement was supposed to provide, and it's essential to re-evaluate what's being sacrificed for success [(00:58:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3538s)
- Prioritizing personal enjoyment, such as working out, can be a crucial aspect of happiness and should not be sacrificed for the sake of achievement [(00:59:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3575s)
- It's essential to recognize when to change one's mind and adjust strategies as circumstances change, rather than sticking to a plan that no longer works [(01:02:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3762s)

## The Importance of Context and Discernment [(01:03:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3781s)
- Successful people often share what they do now, rather than what they did to achieve success, which can be misleading for those seeking advice [(01:03:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3781s)
- It's crucial to consider the context of the person giving advice and to discern what is useful and applicable to one's own situation [(01:03:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=3820s)
- The ability to distinguish between useful and useless information is a vital skill for achieving success and making informed decisions [(01:06:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4013s)

## Applying Principles with Nuance [(01:07:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4033s)
- Applying principles from others' experiences requires nuance and consideration of one's specific circumstances, rather than simply copying their approach [(01:07:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4033s)
- It's essential to be able to extract useful information from others' experiences and apply it in a way that is tailored to one's own situation [(01:08:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4112s)
- The skill of discerning what is useful and what is not is critical for achieving a disproportionate return on one's life and efforts [(01:09:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4151s)

## The Value of Experience and Adaptation [(01:09:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4172s)
- Experience, both good and bad, can provide valuable lessons and insights that can be applied to future decisions and actions [(01:09:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4172s)
- The ability to observe, pause, and reflect on experiences is essential for learning and growth, and for developing the skill of discernment [(01:09:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4190s)
- Adapting to changing circumstances and being open to new information and experiences is crucial for continued growth and success [(01:10:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4211s)

## Alex’s Blueprint For A Successful Life [(01:13:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4398s)
- Figuring out what you want is 99% of achieving success, and once you know what you want, getting it is the easy part [(01:13:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4434s)
- It's essential to give yourself permission to change what you want in any given moment and not be held back by sunk cost bias [(01:14:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4472s)
- People often want it all, but everything has a price, and you will never be able to get everything without making trades and sacrifices [(01:17:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4640s)

## The Human Condition [(01:16:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4567s)
- Humans want it all and are not willing to make trades, which leads to regret and dissatisfaction [(01:16:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4584s)
- People often lament the present and want to go back to a previous time in their life, but this is often due to nostalgia and a biased view of the past [(01:19:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=4796s)
- The concept of "golden years" is often only appreciated in hindsight, and people rarely think they are living through a golden era in the present moment [(01:25:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5151s)

## Accepting Suffering and the Fading Affect Bias [(01:26:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5206s)
- Accepting suffering and not trying to fix everything can be helpful, as punishment and negative experiences fade with time, while rewards and positive experiences stick [(01:27:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5246s)
- The fading affect bias means that people tend to remember the good times more than the bad, but this can become a problem if they lament the present [(01:27:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5264s)

## Why You Need To Master The Boring, Mundane Middle [(01:28:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5289s)
- Mastering the middle, the boring and exhausting part of a journey, is where winning happens, and it's essential to develop this skill to achieve success [(01:28:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5289s)
- People's happiness for someone's success is often proportional to where they are on the ladder relative to that person, and their support can change as the person achieves more [(01:29:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5346s)
- Dealing with uncertainty is a crucial skill, and it's essential to be aware that people who doubt others will be right most of the time, but the optimists can still get rich due to intensity [(01:30:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5435s)

## The Importance of Surrounding Yourself with the Right People [(01:31:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5492s)
- The best way to know who a real friend is, is by how they react when you win, and it's rare to find people who genuinely want you to win [(01:31:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5513s)
- One should only take advice from people whose dreams for your life are bigger than yours, and it's essential to be discerning about the people you surround yourself with [(01:32:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5553s)
- Having a small circle of supportive people can make a significant difference in achieving success, and it's crucial to find people who believe in you more than you do [(01:33:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5590s)

## Embracing Uncertainty and Intensity [(01:34:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5660s)
- Uncertainty is a natural part of the journey to success, and it's essential to develop the skill to deal with it, even if it's uncomfortable [(01:34:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5677s)
- Intensity can make all the difference in achieving success, and it's possible to be so right one time that it makes all the times you were wrong irrelevant [(01:35:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5715s)
- The downside risk of taking a chance may be smaller and more frequent, but the upside is uncapped, and it's essential to consider this when making decisions [(01:36:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=5769s)

## If You’re 22, You Don’t Need A Work-Life Balance [(01:41:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6097s)
- At 22, one should focus on their ambitions rather than seeking work-life balance, as this stage of life is ideal for building foundations for future success [(01:41:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6097s)
- Criticism from others can be a catalyst for growth, and one should learn to accept and discern constructive feedback to improve themselves [(01:42:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6131s)
- Young individuals have advantages such as high energy levels, nothing to lose, and low responsibilities, which can be leveraged to achieve their goals [(01:48:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6500s)

## Embracing Challenges and Feedback [(01:46:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6370s)
- It's essential to prioritize goals and focus on one goal at a time to increase the likelihood of success [(01:46:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6408s)
- Having nothing to lose can be a significant advantage, as it allows young individuals to take risks and pursue opportunities without fear of failure [(01:48:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=6519s)
- Discerning useful feedback from others requires skills such as identifying aligned incentives and domain expertise [(02:00:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7213s)

## The True Meaning Of Success [(02:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7279s)
- Success requires wanting it more than hating the process to get it, and being willing to put in effort consistently, even if it's just for a short period like 100 days [(02:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7279s)
- People often underestimate how simple success can be and overestimate how easy it is to achieve, leading to disappointment when expectations aren't met [(02:02:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7337s)
- It's essential to understand that desire is a contract with oneself to be unhappy until a goal is achieved, and if one is not willing to put in the work, they should release themselves from the desire [(02:03:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7416s)

## Understanding Behavior Change [(02:04:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7452s)
- Behavior change can occur rapidly, and it's possible to change habits and behaviors quickly, especially when the conditions or environment change [(02:04:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7452s)
- People often change when they're in relationships because their partner influences their behavior, and when the relationship ends, the conditions change, leading to new behaviors [(02:08:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7700s)
- It's not necessary to understand why a behavior changed, but rather to focus on the observable changes and whether they contribute to achieving goals [(02:12:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=7951s)

## The Pursuit of Understanding Why [(02:14:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8042s)
- The pursuit of understanding why something happens can be a source of joy and fascination, even if the answer is not always knowable [(02:17:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8231s)
- Focusing on understanding why can be seen as mental masturbation, but it can also be a valuable pursuit if it brings happiness and improves well-being [(02:19:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8354s)
- The pursuit of why can be a goal in itself, and even if it's pointless, it can still bring momentary happiness and satisfaction [(02:21:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8502s)

## The Power Of Trying Anything Even If You Suck [(02:22:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8523s)
- Most people quit after the first sign of difficulty because they've never known what hard feels like, and trying can be enough to beat most people [(02:22:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8540s)
- Consistency is key to success, but it's hard to see in a snapshot, and large amounts of exposure are needed to learn certain lessons [(02:22:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8578s)
- The act of trying is important, and people often don't understand what it looks like to put tremendous effort into something, with many not willing to trade more for what they want [(02:23:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8617s)

## The Importance of Consistency and Trying [(02:27:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8849s)
- Consistency never looks impressive in the moment, only at the end, and trying is opaque, with outcomes being obvious [(02:28:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8907s)
- Working hard and being consistent can put someone in a rarified strata of people, and the bigger the goal, the fewer people pursuing it [(02:27:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8869s)
- People often don't witness the process of trying and consistency, only the outcomes, and don't understand what it takes to achieve success [(02:29:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=8942s)

- People often defend someone else's beliefs without being willing to accept someone else's beliefs, and strong beliefs should be held loosely [(02:36:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9394s)
- Changing one's mind and being open to new ideas is important, and people should be willing to question their own beliefs and defend their own opinions [(02:36:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9412s)

## Original Thinking and Agency [(02:40:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9644s)
- Original thinking is rare, and many people copy the opinions of their favorite influencers, who in turn copy the opinions of mass media [(02:40:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9644s)
- Conceptual inertia can make it hard for people to change their beliefs, and thinking is hard, which is why many people delegate it [(02:41:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9681s)
- Reasoning from first principles and coming up with one's own opinions can give people agency and the ability to sustain their course over time [(02:42:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9720s)

## Why Pain Is Necessary For Real Progress [(02:43:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9836s)
- Progress requires getting used to pain, and every new challenge shows that one can survive and handle more than before [(02:43:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9836s)
- Telling oneself "you're fine" during hard times can provide reassurance and a sense of control, helping to cope with novel situations [(02:44:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9874s)
- Having evidence of past experiences and knowing that one has already withstood difficult situations can help build confidence to handle new challenges [(02:45:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=9910s)

## Chosen and Unchosen Suffering [(02:48:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10103s)
- There's a difference between chosen and unchosen suffering, with the latter being more difficult to prepare for and often providing more opportunities for growth [(02:48:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10103s)
- Reframing suffering as an opportunity to create evidence of one's character and abilities can be a powerful tool for personal growth [(02:50:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10232s)
- Storytelling and the narrative of one's life can be influenced by the challenges and suffering one faces, making for a more interesting and epic story [(02:51:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10291s)

## How To Find True Love [(02:52:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10375s)
- When considering marriage, it's essential to look at the statistics and how the relationship has improved one's life, rather than just focusing on emotions [(02:53:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10393s)
- Many people chase the initial excitement of a relationship rather than the long-term stability and compatibility [(02:54:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10454s)
- Falling in love can be compared to taking a powerful drug, and during this time, one's decision-making abilities may be impaired [(02:55:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10517s)

## A Heartbreaking Love Letter [(02:58:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10688s)
- Richard Fineman's love letter to his wife is a powerful expression of love and devotion, even after her passing [(02:58:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10705s)
- The letter highlights the depth of their relationship and the ways in which they connected and supported each other [(02:59:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10743s)
- The idea of loving someone even after they're gone can be a complex and beautiful emotion, and it's essential to consider how one wants to be remembered and loved by their partner [(03:01:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=10867s)

## Should You Be Jacked & Rich Before Finding Love? [(03:03:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11006s)
- Finding the right person is rare, and when you do, you should prioritize them, as they can help you become the best version of yourself [(03:03:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11006s)
- Biology and societal expectations can create pressure on women to find a partner and have kids before a certain age, which can lead to settling for someone who isn't a good match [(03:04:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11076s)
- Having a partner who supports and accepts you for who you are, and who you want to become, is crucial for a successful relationship [(03:05:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11116s)

## The Importance of Finding the Right Partner [(03:07:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11226s)
- A good partner should help you become more of yourself, not dilute your personality or make you change who you are [(03:07:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11226s)
- Having someone who loves and accepts you for who you are can give you the confidence to be yourself and pursue your goals [(03:07:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11262s)
- Finding a partner who shares your values and goals can be challenging, but it's essential for building a strong and lasting relationship [(03:08:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11298s)

## The Challenges of Finding a Compatible Partner [(03:09:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11356s)
- As people get older, their habits and lifestyles become more ingrained, making it harder to find someone who is compatible [(03:09:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11356s)
- Having a large age gap or different life stages can create challenges in a relationship [(03:12:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11572s)
- It's essential to find someone who loves you for who you are, not just for your status or material possessions [(03:13:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11590s)

- A good partner should be your ally and support you in your endeavors, rather than holding you back [(03:15:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11705s)
- Finding someone who is competent, trustworthy, and aligned with your values can be a significant advantage in life and business [(03:17:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=11854s)

## How To Land A Top Tier Girl [(03:21:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12119s)
- To attract a top-tier girl, one should get in shape, as it enhances attractiveness and increases the pool of potential partners [(03:21:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12119s)
- Getting rich is also important, but it's more about signaling the ability to gain resources rather than having them, as it indicates ambition and potential [(03:24:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12242s)
- Not being a jerk is also crucial, which means avoiding behaviors that decrease the likelihood of a girl wanting to continue interacting with you [(03:25:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12319s)

## Importance of Self-Improvement and Authenticity
- Being in shape, rich, and not being a jerk can increase one's chances of attracting a top-tier girl, but it's also important to be authentic and not pretend to be someone you're not [(03:27:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12439s)
- Having non-negotiables and being upfront about them can help in finding a compatible partner, as it sets expectations and avoids potential issues [(03:27:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12420s)
- Focusing on the few things that will not change about oneself over time, rather than trying to find a perfect match based on surface-level characteristics, can be a more effective approach to finding a long-term partner [(03:29:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12544s)

## You Don’t Need Work-Life Balance If You’re Obsessed [(03:30:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12623s)
- People who obsess about work-life balance are typically mediocre at both, and obsessed individuals apply their obsession to everything and call it life [(03:30:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12623s)
- Communication is key in relationships, and assuming the best intention, or "running up," can help prevent misunderstandings [(03:31:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12680s)
- Dissecting issues and addressing preferences in behavior can make relationships easier to navigate, especially when both partners are responsive to feedback [(03:32:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12752s)

## The Importance of Feedback and Adaptability
- Being responsive to feedback and willing to change behavior can strengthen relationships and make them less emotionally charged [(03:34:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=12883s)
- People often attribute certain behaviors or traits to their sense of self, but these can be changed or improved without losing one's identity [(03:37:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13035s)
- Viewing oneself as a collection of behaviors rather than a fixed identity can make it easier to adapt and change for the benefit of others [(03:40:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13203s)

## Don't Be Surprised By Results You Didn't Work For [(03:40:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13258s)
- People often don't know how to finish what they start and demand success without putting in the necessary work [(03:40:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13258s)
- Learning to try really hard at one thing for an extended period can become a generalizable skill across different domains [(03:41:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13300s)
- The better one gets at something, the more repetitions it takes to become even slightly better, and the returns on effort are highest at the top [(03:43:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13389s)
- Willpower can wane over time, but the returns on effort are often highest when progress is slowest [(03:43:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13424s)
- Focusing on one thing can make it less desirable to start something new, as one knows what it takes to achieve a high level of proficiency [(03:45:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13500s)
- It's essential to consider whether putting more effort into one area will lead to significant improvements and a better life [(03:45:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13517s)

## Alex’s Journey Of Discovering Meditation [(03:45:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13548s)
- Meditation can improve subjective well-being, with Buddhist monks who have meditated for over 40,000 hours showing three to four standard deviations above the norm in happiness [(03:45:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13548s)
- To replicate these outcomes, it may take around four hours of meditation per day, with one hour a day for a decade potentially leading to one to one and a half standard deviations of improvement [(03:46:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13607s)
- The goal of meditation is to achieve a constant state of bliss, described as a state of permanent abiding non-dual awareness, which can be attained through dedicated practice [(03:48:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=13680s)

## Spending Money Effectively [(03:53:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14030s)
- Money does not buy happiness past $70,000 per year, as spending money effectively is a skill that many people never acquire [(03:53:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14030s)
- Effective spending can include hiring help to free up time, such as a housekeeper or cook, which can cost around $1,500 per month and save around 90 hours per month [(03:54:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14088s)
- For those earning more than $70,000 per year, spending money on experiences and services that improve daily life, such as food prep or a personal driver, can be a worthwhile investment [(03:56:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14162s)

## Reflecting On Alex’s Changed Mindset Over The Past Year [(03:58:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14303s)
- The biggest update in beliefs is that it's possible to be both useful and happy, rather than trading one for the other [(03:58:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14323s)
- Being specific about moments and not extrapolating them to longer periods of time is another key change, focusing on spreading good things and shrinking bad ones into the smallest possible space [(03:59:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14340s)
- Avoiding the "second arrow" of suffering is also a major area of focus, actively working on changing perspective on reality [(03:59:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky1oHHJ5Ne8&t=14357s)

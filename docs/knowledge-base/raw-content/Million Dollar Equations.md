- Lifetime gross profit compared to the cost to acquire a customer is a key metric to understand the fundamental economic unit of a business, with a higher ratio indicating a more attractive business [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=0s)
- To calculate lifetime gross profit, it's necessary to determine the average customer lifespan and the gross profit per customer, which can be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the revenue [(00:00:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=54s)
- The cost to acquire a customer (CAC) includes not only advertising expenses but also labor and other costs, and can be calculated by dividing the total monthly costs by the number of customers acquired [(00:06:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=410s)
- Return on invested capital is crucial when expanding a business, considering the costs of scaling, such as hiring more staff or purchasing new equipment, and the time it takes to break even [(00:09:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=540s)
- The payback period is an essential metric, indicating how quickly an investment is paid back, with a preferred return of at least 3:1, meaning if $1 is invested, $3 should be returned [(00:10:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=621s)
- Sales velocity times lifetime gross profit is a key metric for predicting a business's future revenue, helping to estimate where the business will even out if nothing else changes [(00:16:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=965s)
- The lifetime value of a customer can change for a business if the turnover rate increases, for example, from 5% to 10%, which would cut the lifetime revenue in half [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=1075s).
- Sales velocity divided by churn can help determine the hypothetical maximum number of customers a business can sustain, with churn defined as the number of customers who leave, such as 10% per month [(00:18:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=1127s).
- Total Addressable Market (TAM) is a key factor in assessing the potential size of a company, calculated by multiplying the number of potential units by lifetime gross profit and dividing by risk [(00:19:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcjweehrvU&t=1193s).
